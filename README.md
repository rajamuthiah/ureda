uReda: Shape analysis of high-throughput experiments data.
==========================================================

Provides tools for the "high-throughput" (u)nderstanding
of (r)obust (e)xploratory (d)ata (a)nalysis of high-throughput
genomics/transcriptomics/proteomics experiment data. 
In particular we implement the ideas in "Shape analysis 
of high-throughput transcriptomics experiment data", 
which has its foundations in Tukey's g-and-h distribution 
and the theory of L-moments.
